Tactical Player Scouting System

Project Overview

The Tactical Player Scouting System leverages data science to enhance the scouting process for football clubs. By analyzing team tactics and player attributes, the system identifies and recommends players who best fit a club’s playing style. The project integrates advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and explainable AI to improve recruitment decisions and optimize player acquisitions.

Objectives

Data Science Objectives

Develop a Tactically Aware Player Similarity Metric

Create a metric that quantifies how well a player matches a team's tactical requirements.

Incorporate factors such as passing style, defensive contributions, pressing intensity, and positional suitability.

Utilize feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and similarity scoring.

Build a Predictive Model for Player Performance in a Tactical Context

Develop models to predict how well a player will perform within a specific team’s system.

Use regression/classification techniques incorporating individual attributes and tactical fit.

Employ model selection, training, and evaluation with appropriate performance metrics.

Create an Explainable Recommendation System

Provide clear and understandable explanations for player recommendations.

Utilize feature importance analysis, rule extraction, and natural language generation to justify selections.

Business Objectives

Increase the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Player Scouting

Reduce the time and resources required for scouting.
